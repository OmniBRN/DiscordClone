## How it was made

**Tech Stack**:
- ASP.NET Core MVC – Used to implement the Model-View-Controller pattern for a clean and scalable architecture.
- Entity Framework Core – For database interactions using a code-first approach.
- ASP.NET Identity – Provides user authentication, registration, and role management.
- Lazy Loading – Optimizes performance by loading related data only when it’s needed.
- Razor Views – Used for dynamic rendering of UI content from the server side.
- Bootstrap – For responsive and clean UI styling.
- LINQ – Utilized for querying and manipulating data within the application.
- MySQL (Docker Container) – Deployed within a Docker container to ensure environment consistency and isolate dependencies across development.

## How it looks

## Known Issues
* Real-time messaging is currently in progress
* No mobile specific layout yet
* Notifications are basic and need enhancement

## Lessons Learned

This was our my first larger-scale ASP.NET projects, and it gave us a deeper experience with key backend development principles, especially:

Implementing secure and flexible user authentication and role systems
* Structuring a multi-role communication platform using MVC
* Managing performance with lazy loading and efficient data access patterns
* Working with relational data using Entity Framework and LINQ
* Building a scalable system with modular architecture and clean UI/UX

Through building this project, We’ve gained hands-on experience in architecting full-stack ASP.NET apps preparing us for even more complex system designs.
